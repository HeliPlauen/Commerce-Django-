"By the battleship for yourself, if you wish!
You can by here everything!
Tanks, artillerry, aircraft, armored cars and trains, battleships - everything for WWI"

This is the repository with my 2 educational task in Django (simplified version of web application for online auction, course â€“ Web Programming) 

Come to this app, create your account there and by or sell (not really!!!!) WWI armor!
You can also make your rates and comment lots (if you are authenticated off course). 
If your rate requires the lot-owner, he stops trade and you become a winner (and receive message about it).

Here you may see a few screenshots.
